## Research
My doctoral research  focuses on educational decision-making of young people, with a focus 
on human capital investment (read education). I use diverse econometric and experimental 
methods to analyse how students make choices about their education, and the economic implications 
of such actions. I am especially interested in the confluence of students' peer networks 
and non-cognitive skills, and the study of these in resource-scarce settings, i.e. Low and Middle-Income Countries. 
Some of the applied work that I do happens in Mexico, my home country.

In collaboration with the International Labour Organisation, we revised and proposed
a new framework with which to understand young people's aspirations as a 
determinant of their future economic outcomes, and a complement to succesful employment policies.
The paper, [Youth aspirations and the future of work](https://www.ilo.org/employment/Whatwedo/Publications/WCMS_790120/lang--en/index.htm)
was jointly written with Drew Gardiner and Micheline Goedhuys. 

In related work, I design a video-intervention to affect aspirations of high school 
students in Mexico. The Randomized Controlled trial was carried out during the 2018-2019
school year, with 45 participating schools from the Midwestern region of Mexico. We show that
low-cost technological interventions, paired with a social networkdriven approach, are 
effective policy tools to decrease information asymettries and optimise 
student-decision making, through their aspirations. 

I am also interested in mechanisms that maximise the benefits of scarce resources in low to
middle income countries (LMICs). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I co-founded the
project [Test and Contain](http://testandcontain.com), which considers the problem of utilising
limited testing resources in an optimal way so as to minimise the impact on the health and
livelihoods of those who are hardest hit in LMICs. This project is supported by an ACM SIGecom
GCEC'20 grant. For more information, watch the 1 minute

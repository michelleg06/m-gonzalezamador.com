## Research
My doctoral research  focuses on educational decision-making of young people, with a focus 
on human capital investment (read education). I use diverse econometric and experimental 
methods to analyse how students make choices about their education, and the economic implications 
of such actions. I am especially interested in the confluence of students' peer networks 
and non-cognitive skills, and the study of these in resource-scarce settings, i.e. Low and Middle-Income Countries. 
Some of the applied work that I do happens in Mexico, my home country.

In collaboration with the International Labour Organisation, we revised and proposed
a new framework with which to understand young people's aspirations as 
determinants of their future economic outcomes, and complements to succesful employment policies.
The paper, [Youth aspirations and the future of work](https://www.ilo.org/employment/Whatwedo/Publications/WCMS_790120/lang--en/index.htm)
was jointly written with Drew Gardiner and Micheline Goedhuys. 

In related work, I design a video-intervention to affect aspirations of high school 
students in Mexico. The Randomized Controlled Trial was carried out during the 2018-2019
school year, with 45 participating schools from the Midwestern region of Mexico. We show that
low-cost technological interventions, paired with a social network-driven approach, are 
effective policy tools to decrease information asymmetries and optimise 
student-decision making, through their aspirations. 

I am also interested in ethics, equity and redistribution. With Chinasa T. Okolo, we design
an ethics and empathy driven approach to evaluate the use of Artificial Intelligence on patients
in healthcare settings. The paper [ACIPS: A Framework for Evaluating Patient Perception in the Introduction of AI-Enabled Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04456)
is available at Arxiv. With Edwin Lock and Simon Finster, we are currently working on understanding
how exposure to narratives and peer behaviour affects reource-rich country citizens' willingness to
share vaccines with resource-poor countries, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information, you can visit the project's website

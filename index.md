## About me
I'm a PhD Candidate at the United Nations University, Maastricht Economic and Social Research Institute on Innovation and Technology (UNU-MERIT) and Maastricht University, School of Business and Economics (SBE). My thesis research focuses on complex socioeconomic systems, with a focus on human capital investment (read education) of young people. I use diverse econometric, algorithmic and experimental methods to analyse how young people interact with themselves, systems and technology, and the economic implications of such actions. I am especially interested in the confluence of students' peer networks, technological innovations and non-cognitive skills, and the study of these in resource-scarce settings, i.e. Low and Middle-Income Countries. Some of the applied work that I do happens in Mexico, my home country.  

I am involved in the [Mechanism Design for Social Good community](http://www.md4sg.com). If you're interested in proposing solutions to tackle one or many of the issues affecting the [Latin American and Caribbean region](https://www.md4sg.com/workinggroups/latinamerica.html), and would like to meet with like-minded people to discuss or collaborate with, do write us! 

> ðŸ“£ ðŸ“£ ðŸ“£The MD4SG-LAC community is currently collaborating with COPOCYT in San Luis PotosÃ­, MÃ©xico to mentor young indigenous women who aspire to do scientific research and/or graduate work. We are looking for funds to sponsor a trip for them to present their work in Washington D.C. at the EAAMO'22 Conference. If you would like to donate to help them achieve their dream, please reach out to me.


Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed a BA in International Relations (2008-2013) at Mexico's Tec de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara, with a specialisation in Political Science from Sciences Po Rennes, in France. I also hold a Master of Public Policy, with a Policy Analysis and Economic Development concentration from the Hertie School of Governance  in Berlin (2013-2015). I have also done consulting work for the World Bank Group (2016-2018) and the International Labour Organisation (2019).

## About me
I'm a PhD Candidate at the United Nations University, Maastricht Economic and Social Research Institute on Innovation and Technology (UNU-MERIT) and Maastricht University, School of Business and Economics (SBE). My thesis research focuses on educational decision-making of young people, with a focus on human capital investment (read education). I use diverse econometric and experimental methods to analyse how students make choices about their education, and the economic implications of such actions. I am especially interested in the confluence of students' peer networks and non-cognitive skills, and the study of these in resource-scarce settings, i.e. Low and Middle-Income Countries. Some of the applied work that I do happens in Mexico, my home country.  

I am involved in the [Mechanism Design for Social Good community](http://www.md4sg.com). If you're interested in proposing solutions to tackle one or many of the issues affecting the [Latin American and Caribbean region](https://www.md4sg.com/workinggroups/latinamerica.html), and would like to meet with like-minded people to discuss or collaborate with, do write us!
